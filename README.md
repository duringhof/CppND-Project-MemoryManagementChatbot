# CppND: Memory Management Chatbot

This is the project for the third course in the [Udacity C++ Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/c-plus-plus-nanodegree--nd213): Memory Management.

The repository you're looking at originates from [this Udacity starter code repo](https://github.com/udacity/CppND-Memory-Management-Chatbot.git) and contains the specific implementations/solutions that I wrote to pass the course.

At the moment, this is A WORK IN PROGRESS !!! Once the project is done, I'll update the readme accordingly.
