# CppND: Memory Management Chatbot

This repository contains the result of the third project of the [Udacity C++ Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/c-plus-plus-nanodegree--nd213). The project concerns a simple chatbot that answers on questions about memory management concepts. While the chatbot functionality itself is rather limited in terms of possible questions and answers, the project emphasized learnings from the Memory Management course of the program which can be seen "behind the scenes" in the chatbot implementation that make use of e.g. smart pointers, move semantics etc... 

The repository you're looking at originates from [this Udacity starter code repo](https://github.com/udacity/CppND-Memory-Management-Chatbot.git) and contains the specific implementations/solutions that I wrote to pass the course.
